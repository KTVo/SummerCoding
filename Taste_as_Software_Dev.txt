#Things you'll learn after going in:
------------------------------------
#1
#Don't ever think my way is the only way. In programming, it's all about trade-offs
#Just stick with the approach I know best while learning from others.

#2
#There's too much to learn. You'll always learn as you go. Tech changes quick.

#3
#Some companies don't always know how to develop software ineffeciently and struggle to
#meet their own deadlines

#4
#Sine companies don't care if their code is outdated, less-stable, or inefficient. They
#just want you to produce software quickly. So they'll work around poorly written
#code instead of redoing it.

#5
#Building applications is HARD! Just because you can code DOES NOT mean you can
#provide a good user experience




#Avoid these horrible study habits:
-----------------------------------
#1
#Separate studying from playing. No movies/gaming while studying.
#Have free-time separate from study-time
#Not doing still will motivate mean

#2
#ex: repeat 25 mins of studying -> 5 minutes break 
# OR
#45 mins of studying -> 15 minutes off

#3
#When working, NOT distractions!
#Check phone or do whatever during break

#4
#Do not spend every waking moment studying
#You'll need a break. Sometimes the whole day.
#Your brain is like a muscle. It needs a break.



#Learning strategies for Programming:
-------------------------------------
#1
#Need to be systematic with learning. Don't just hope that I will learn well without a system.

#2
#Know my sweet spot of active and passive learning

	#passive learning - reading a book, taking in information without doing an exercise.

	#active learning - hands-on learning. Applying what I've learned like doing a project.
#		^better for problem-solving

	#When starting out have 2:1 of passive:active

	#Once I am better have 1:1 of passive:active

#3
#Apply spacing to my learning.
#Avoid cramming every in one day. Spreading my learning 1 hour per day.

#4
#After learning. Write a blog-post on what I've learned to summarized my learning.

#5
#Keep track of all my questions. Write it in a .txt or something to find the answers later.

#6
#Know when to rest and recover from learning.
#Take time off to sleep
#Take time off to think about other things
#Hang out
#Chores

#7
#Manage my stress level.
#High stress level or not sleeping can lower my IQ by 10 pts


#How to have a Productive Day:
-----------------------------
#1
#Do 25 minutes of work then 5 min break repeatedly
#After every 4 intervals take a LONG BREAK

#2
#Plan Day out before it occurs

#3
#Stay focus, remove all distractions

#4
#Just do the freakin' work!

#5
#Prioritize everything I do

#How to Study:
--------------

#1
#Get specific on what I am trying to learn
#	Question myself, do I truly know it or it just makes sense
#	when someone else explains it.
	

#2
#Learn once you are able to recreate something without even a 
#	hint.


#3
#Find what I am stuck on by attempting it then focus/target it
#	by going back 1 step
	
#4
#Once I've learned anything go back to it once a week
#	to avoid relearning it
	
#	*** In the end, be able to redo the problem from scratch.
